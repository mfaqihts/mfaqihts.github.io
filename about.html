            Fresh Graduate with an Electrical Engineering major focusing on
            Systems and Control topics. Have a strong interest in Automation,
            Data, and Computing technology that could optimize vast amounts of
            engineering problems. I relish working together as a team of
            engineers and contributing to the development of overall society's
            well-being by either designing a brand-new product or improving an
            existing one.

            My passion is on what the future holds. As a Data Enthusiast, I am
            interested in automation based on data since that's where the future
            relied on. Confidence in using Matlab, and Python as my daily tools
            is really helping me to keep my pace with the vast world of
            engineering. I also managed to build projects with microcontrollers
            in my spare time to enhance my skills
